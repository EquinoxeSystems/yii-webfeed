# WebFeed

WebFeed is a Yii 1.1 extension which provides generetors for [ATOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)) and [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) [web feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed), which were very popular in the "blog era" (before the explosion of the social network and microblogging companies) for implementing [web syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication). Currently it seems that RSS (mostly used for podcasts nowadays) is [gaining](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716813/google-chrome-follow-button-rss-reader) new support.
